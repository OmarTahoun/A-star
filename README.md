# [A* search algorithm demonstration](https://omartahoun.github.io/A-star/)

This is a demonstration of the A*  search algorithm, I did it in both JS and python and the repo includes both.

## Features:
- A* full search

- Step by Step search

- Ability to resize the Grid

- Building Personal grids
  - Setting your own blocks
  - changing the start and the target points

- Saving the search result as an image to your device.

- User can choose to move digonally or not.

## What everything does:
- __Slider__ : sets the size of the grid.

- __Step__ : moves one step in the search for the end point.

- __search__ : Searching for the full & optimal path to the end point.

- __clear__ : Removes all the blocks from the grid.

- __Reset__ : resets the canvas for a new grid.

- __Edit Drop Down list__ : Chooses what do you want to edit, Blocks/ Start point / end
 point.
 - __Diagonal Drop Down List__ : Toggles the mode of the search weather the diagonal movement is allowed or not. 

## Built with:
- [P5.js](https://p5js.org/)

- JavaScript
